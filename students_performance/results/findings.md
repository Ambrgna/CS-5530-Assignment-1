# Report: 
# Based on the graph, we can see clear gender differences in Math and Reading scores. Overall, students performed better in Reading than in Math. Males tended to score higher in Math, while females generally scored higher in Reading. Additionally, male students had more outliers on the lower end of the scores compared to females, indicating greater variability. This analysis suggests that gender may be associated with differences in performance between these two subjects.
